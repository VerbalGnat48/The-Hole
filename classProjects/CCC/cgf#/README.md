////////// Card Game FUn! //////////

This shows the various iterations of my cgf journey.

Various card games that show the use of doubly-linked lists.

////////// cgf objectives //////////

cgf0 - Lay the framework for our doubly-linked list: implement a deck of cards where you can display piles of cards, navigating through and showing each card in the deck (forward and backward).
Implement a simple game if you wish. Note: we'll be progressing to blackjack to cgf1 and then a freecell-style game in cgf2 using stacks.

cgf1 - With the card functionality and various properties laid out, implement a playable blackjack game using doubly-linked lists (and doubly-linked stacks if appropriate).

cgf2 - Using your experience playing with cards from the previous projects, implement a Freecell or Forty Thieves-style game making use of stacks (Solitaire).

////////// How to use //////////

Use for example: "./cgf0.sh cgf0.v32" to both "make" and run cgf0.
To make: "./cgf0.sh"
To run: "Vircon32 cgf0.v32"
